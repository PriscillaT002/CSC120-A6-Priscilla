- I appreciate the concept of inheritance. From what I understand and have been able to do with it I think it is beneficial for programmers because it saves us time and energy while making our code more coherent.

I think I struggled more on this assignment than on our previous ones becasue I've been dealing with some issues surrounding my mental health causing me to isolate more than usual. I do think that with more studying and practice I will be able to master this concept and get better at coding in JAVA. This assignment was interesting and fun to work through. If I could do it all over I would've started it earlier so that I didn't have to eat at my extension days. That leads me into my advise for future students, start early and ask for help if you feel comfortable doing so.
